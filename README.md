Thanks so much by stopping by my website–I really appreciate it!

*This website is always maintained, and I try to update it as much as I can, so bear with me as I navigate these changes :)*

## website description, use, etc.
I have a LinkedIn, but this website is basically a smaller version of my LinkedIn; I also wanted to work on my design skills, and I *hate* domains and website builders, so this is it!

The current version of this website is updated to 2023; this is the third version! I will probably upload its previous version from September 2022 (just for comparison) in the future. Unfortunately, I don't have the initial version, so that won't be put up (probably ever)!

## credits
I got my inspiration from [Zac Holman](https://zachholman.com/), who created his template on R; I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to remove it from R (for some reason, R doesn't work on my computer)

Also usual credits to Googling things from websites like:

 - Geeks4Geeks
 - W3Schools
 - Web.dev
 - StackEdit.io (for helping write this README)
